 <p>JK Rowling finished the groundbreaking series with a remarkable resolution. Harry Potter and The Deathly Hallows concludes all the loose ends and plot points, leaving just enough mystery to allow the reader to feel satisfied yet still desiring for more in the perfect way with her second to best novel in the series.
     
     To completely understand this, you have to read the books prior to this one, so it all makes sense.

Harry Potter and The Deathly Hallows is a tremendous mix of slow parts in some places and non stop action in others. The end of the saga wraps up the final questions and character arcs and really gives Ron a chance to shine. The morals of Dumbledore are additionally questioned in a way that doesn't make him feel like a completely separate character, but rather a character who was hiding his completely separate character from others. I also full under the group that had no problem with the epilogue. Though I do think Rowling should have stuck to either honoring Dumbledore or Snape, not both by naming Harry's son "Albus Severus Potter", that just seemed a bit much. There are some plot points that also feel like a bit of a work around was used or points that Rowling asks us to suspend our disbelief and not just in a magical sort of way, but as an author she's earned our trust at this points and the series has at well so those moments didn't necessarily ruin the book for me. I also felt that there were some characters and plot points that Rowling had to clarify after the series ended when I'd rather have had it clarified in The Deathly Hallows instead. </p>

 <p>Percy Jackson is a great book by Rick Riordan. I found this book out of the series very interesting and if like me you also love the Greek and Roman mythology as much as I do you will realize how amazing the book is. I found the addition of monsters and greek gods to the life of a boy living in the present world very great. The pace of introducing new characters to the story was perfect. Percy, who was a normal kid found out that he was a demigod, or a half blood and the son of Poseidon, god of the sea and went to camp half-blood to embark on a quest to return Zeus' master bolt, who thought that Percy was the lightning thief, or the person who stole his bolt after his mother had been burnt to crisp by a monster. Annabeth Chase and Underwood help him on t his quest. 
     
     During his quest, he met many people like Medusa, Ares, etc. and also found three pearls. When he went to the underworld, which was controlled by Hades, he went to confront him, but as he did, the lightning bolt appeared in his bag. Hades threatened the three of them, and told that if he gave the bolt, he would returned his mother, however Percy didn't comply and used the pearls to get out of there. He later went to Olympus, which is said to be on the 600th floor in the Empire State Building, and handed over the bolt to Zeus, while Poseidon congratulated him. Overall, it was an amazing way to start the series, and I loved it!
